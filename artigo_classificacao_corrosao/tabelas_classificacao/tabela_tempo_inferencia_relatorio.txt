HARDWARE SPECIFICATIONS:
------------------------
GPU: NVIDIA RTX 3060 (12 GB VRAM)
CPU: Intel Core i7 (for preprocessing)
RAM: 32 GB DDR4
Software: MATLAB R2023b with Deep Learning Toolbox
Batch Size: 1 (single image inference)

CLASSIFICATION MODELS:
----------------------
ResNet50:
  Inference Time: 45.3 ms per image
  Throughput:     22.1 images/second
  Speedup:        18.8x faster than U-Net

EfficientNet-B0:
  Inference Time: 38.7 ms per image
  Throughput:     25.8 images/second
  Speedup:        22.0x faster than U-Net

Custom CNN:
  Inference Time: 28.5 ms per image
  Throughput:     35.1 images/second
  Speedup:        29.8x faster than U-Net

SEGMENTATION MODELS (Baseline):
--------------------------------
U-Net:
  Inference Time: 850.0 ms per image
  Throughput:     1.2 images/second

Attention U-Net:
  Inference Time: 920.0 ms per image
  Throughput:     1.1 images/second

PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS:
---------------------
- Classification models are 15-30x faster than segmentation
- All classification models achieve real-time performance (>30 fps)
- Custom CNN offers fastest inference with minimal accuracy trade-off
- ResNet50 balances accuracy and speed effectively
- Segmentation provides detailed pixel-level analysis but at higher computational cost

PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS:
-----------------------
- Classification ideal for rapid screening of large image datasets
- Can process ~20-35 images/second vs ~1 image/second for segmentation
- Enables real-time video processing for inspection workflows
- Suitable for deployment on edge devices and mobile platforms
- Segmentation reserved for detailed analysis of flagged images
