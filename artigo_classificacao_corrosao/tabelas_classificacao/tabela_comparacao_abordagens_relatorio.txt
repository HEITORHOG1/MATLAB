STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESSES:
--------------------------

CLASSIFICATION STRENGTHS:
+ Fast inference (15-30x speedup)
+ Low computational requirements
+ Suitable for real-time applications
+ Easy deployment on edge devices
+ Efficient for large-scale screening
+ Quick training time

CLASSIFICATION WEAKNESSES:
- No spatial information about corrosion location
- Cannot quantify exact corroded area
- Less detailed than segmentation
- Threshold-dependent class boundaries

SEGMENTATION STRENGTHS:
+ Detailed pixel-level corrosion mapping
+ Precise spatial localization
+ Exact corroded area quantification
+ Visual mask overlay for interpretation
+ Highest accuracy for detailed analysis

SEGMENTATION WEAKNESSES:
- Slow inference (850-920 ms per image)
- High computational requirements
- Not suitable for real-time applications
- Requires powerful hardware
- Long training time

RECOMMENDED USE CASES:
----------------------

USE CLASSIFICATION WHEN:
1. Rapid screening of large image datasets is needed
2. Real-time processing is required (video inspection)
3. Deploying on resource-constrained devices
4. Severity assessment is sufficient (no spatial detail needed)
5. Processing thousands of images for monitoring
6. Initial triage to identify structures needing detailed analysis

USE SEGMENTATION WHEN:
1. Detailed spatial analysis of corrosion is required
2. Exact corroded area quantification is needed
3. Visual documentation for reports is important
4. Analyzing critical structures requiring detailed assessment
5. Computational resources are available
6. Following up on classification-flagged images

HYBRID WORKFLOW RECOMMENDATION:
--------------------------------
1. Use classification for initial rapid screening of all images
2. Flag images classified as Moderate or Severe corrosion
3. Apply segmentation to flagged images for detailed analysis
4. Generate detailed reports with segmentation masks for critical cases
5. This hybrid approach combines speed and detail effectively

COMPUTATIONAL EFFICIENCY ANALYSIS:
-----------------------------------
For a dataset of 10,000 images:
  Classification only:  ~7-15 minutes total
  Segmentation only:    ~140-150 minutes total
  Hybrid (20% flagged): ~30-40 minutes total
  Time savings:         ~70-75% vs segmentation-only
