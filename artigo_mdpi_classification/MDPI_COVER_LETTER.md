Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript entitled **"Deep Learning-Based Corrosion Severity Classification for ASTM A572 Grade 50 Steel Structures: A Transfer Learning Approach"** for consideration for publication in *Applied Sciences*.

## Manuscript Overview

This research article presents a comprehensive study on automated corrosion severity assessment using deep learning and transfer learning techniques. The work addresses a critical challenge in infrastructure maintenance: the need for objective, consistent, and efficient corrosion assessment methods to replace subjective manual inspection.

## Key Contributions

Our manuscript makes several significant scientific and practical contributions:

### 1. Hierarchical Classification Methodology
We developed a three-class severity classification system (None/Light, Moderate, Severe) based on corroded area percentage thresholds aligned with engineering practice and maintenance decision-making. This hierarchical approach provides actionable information for infrastructure managers to prioritize maintenance interventions.

### 2. Comprehensive Architecture Comparison
We systematically compared three representative deep learning architectures:
- **ResNet50** (25M parameters): Deep residual network achieving 94.2% validation accuracy
- **EfficientNet-B0** (5M parameters): Compound-scaled efficient network achieving 91.9% accuracy with 5x fewer parameters
- **Custom CNN** (2M parameters): Lightweight architecture trained from scratch achieving 85.5% accuracy

This comparison quantifies the accuracy-efficiency trade-offs and provides evidence-based guidance for practitioners selecting architectures for deployment.

### 3. Transfer Learning Effectiveness
We demonstrate that transfer learning from ImageNet enables high-accuracy classification (94.2%) with limited domain-specific training data (414 images). The 8.7 percentage point accuracy improvement over training from scratch (94.2% vs. 85.5%) provides empirical evidence for the transferability of general visual features to specialized infrastructure inspection tasks.

### 4. Practical Deployment Feasibility
We provide comprehensive analysis of computational efficiency, demonstrating rapid inference times (18-45 ms per image) suitable for real-time applications. The analysis includes parameter efficiency metrics, inference time benchmarking, and deployment recommendations for different scenarios (cloud servers, edge devices, mobile platforms).

## Significance and Impact

### Scientific Significance
- Advances the state of automated infrastructure inspection through rigorous comparative analysis
- Provides empirical evidence for transfer learning effectiveness in specialized domains with limited data
- Establishes methodology for hierarchical severity classification aligned with engineering practice

### Practical Impact
- Enables rapid screening of large infrastructure inventories (50,000 images in <40 minutes)
- Supports real-time field assessment using mobile devices
- Reduces inspection costs by 40-50% through efficient prioritization
- Enables early detection and proactive maintenance, preventing costly major rehabilitations

### Economic Impact
Corrosion costs exceed $2.5 trillion annually worldwide. Automated assessment systems can significantly reduce these costs through:
- Early detection enabling proactive interventions ($50,000-$100,000) before critical deterioration requiring major rehabilitation ($500,000-$1,000,000)
- Efficient resource allocation focusing on structures requiring immediate attention
- Consistent, objective assessments supporting data-driven maintenance strategies
