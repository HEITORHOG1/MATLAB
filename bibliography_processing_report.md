  - "IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence" → "IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence"
  - "Medical image analysis" → "Medical Image Analysis"
  - "Nature methods" → "Nature Methods"

### 3. Verify all citations work correctly with English text
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Updated citation keys to match corrected bibliography entries:
  - `\cite{wang2021deep}` → `\cite{wang2018deep}` (corrected year mismatch)
- Removed duplicate bibliography entries:
  - Removed `joo2023machine_1` (duplicate of `joo2023machine`)
- Fixed malformed entries:
  - Corrected `international2021aam` → `astm2021a588` with proper formatting

### 4. Ensure reference consistency throughout document
✅ **COMPLETED**
- Fixed bibliography entry types for proper formatting:
  - Conference papers now use `@inproceedings` with `booktitle`
  - Books now use `@book` with `publisher`
  - Journal articles use `@article` with `journal`
- Standardized capitalization in titles and journal names
- Ensured all ASTM standards follow consistent naming convention

## Technical Improvements Made

### Entry Type Corrections
1. **Conference Papers**: Fixed entries that were incorrectly marked as `@article` but had `booktitle`:
   - `long2015fully`, `hu2018squeeze`, `he2016deep`, `milletari2016v`, `sudre2017generalised`

2. **Books**: Fixed entries that were incorrectly marked as `@article` but were actually books:
   - `goodfellow2016deep`, `fontana2005corrosion`, `melchers2018structural`

3. **Workshop Papers**: Corrected workshop paper entry:
   - `koch2018siamese` → `koch2015siamese` (fixed year and entry type)

### Format Standardization
1. **Journal Names**: Standardized capitalization following academic conventions
2. **Conference Names**: Proper capitalization for conference proceedings
3. **Publisher Information**: Moved publisher info from `journal` to `publisher` field where appropriate

### Quality Assurance
- Created `bibliography_validator.py` script for future validation
- All Portuguese text removed from bibliography file
- Consistent formatting throughout the bibliography
- Proper BibTeX syntax maintained

## Files Modified
1. `referencias.bib` - Main bibliography file with all corrections
2. `artigo_cientifico_corrosao.tex` - Updated citation reference
3. `src/translation/bibliography_validator.py` - Created validation script

## Validation Results
- ✅ No Portuguese text remains in bibliography
- ✅ All entry types are correctly assigned
- ✅ Journal names follow proper capitalization
- ✅ Citations in main document match bibliography entries
- ✅ No duplicate entries remain
- ✅ ASTM standards follow consistent format

## Requirements Compliance
This task fulfills **Requirement 6.3**: "WHEN the bibliography is processed THEN the system SHALL maintain proper citation format while translating any Portuguese titles"

The bibliography is now fully prepared for English publication with:
- International standard citation formats
- Proper academic English terminology
- Consistent formatting throughout
- No Portuguese language content
- Validated citation consistency

## Next Steps
The bibliography is ready for LaTeX compilation and the document can proceed with final quality assurance and publication preparation.
