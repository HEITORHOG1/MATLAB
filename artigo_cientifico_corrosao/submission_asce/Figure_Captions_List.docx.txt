Fig. 1. Experimental methodology flowchart for corrosion detection in ASTM A572 
Grade 50 W-beams using U-Net vs Attention U-Net. The pipeline comprises six phases: 
(1) data acquisition with 217 original corrosion images at 512×512 resolution 
(expanded to 414 after augmentation), (2) preprocessing including normalization 
and data augmentation, (3) parallel training of both architectures with identical 
hyperparameters, (4) model evaluation using IoU, Dice, F1-Score metrics, 
(5) comparative statistical analysis with significance testing and effect size 
calculation, and (6) documentation for reproducibility.


Fig. 2. Comparative performance analysis between U-Net and Attention U-Net 
architectures. (A) Box plots showing distribution of IoU, Dice coefficient, and 
F1-Score metrics across test samples. (B) Performance stratification by corrosion 
severity levels. (C) Precision-Recall curves demonstrating superior trade-off 
achieved by Attention U-Net. Error bars represent 95% confidence intervals. 
Statistical significance (p < 0.001) confirmed through Student's t-test.


Fig. 3. Learning curves showing training and validation performance evolution 
during model training. (A) Training and validation loss curves for both 
architectures over 100 epochs. (B) IoU metric progression demonstrating faster 
convergence and superior final performance of Attention U-Net. (C) Dice 
coefficient evolution showing consistent improvement with attention mechanisms. 
Early stopping was applied at epoch 78 for U-Net and epoch 82 for Attention U-Net 
based on validation loss plateau.


Fig. 4. Visual comparison of segmentations between U-Net and Attention U-Net. 
(A) Success case with well-defined corrosion, (B) Challenging case with subtle 
corrosion, (C) Limitation case with complex geometry. Columns: original image, 
ground truth, U-Net segmentation, Attention U-Net segmentation. Red regions 
indicate corrosion areas detected by the models.
