\section{Introdução}
\label{sec:introducao}

Corrosion in metal structures represents one of the main challenges in contemporary civil engineering, constituting a complex electrochemical phenomenon that progressively compromises the structural integrity of buildings, bridges, towers, and other critical infrastructures \cite{fontana2005corrosion, revie2011uhlig}. This deterioration process, characterized by the gradual oxidation of metallic material when exposed to aggressive environments, results in estimated economic losses exceeding 2.5 trillion dollars annually worldwide, representing approximately 3.4\% of the global Gross Domestic Product \cite{koch2016cost}. In the specific context of ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel W-beams, widely used in large-scale structures due to their superior mechanical properties and optimized strength-to-weight ratio \cite{astm2018a572}, the early and accurate detection of corrosive processes becomes essential to ensure structural safety and extend the service life of constructions.

Traditional structural inspection methods, based on periodic visual assessments and conventional non-destructive techniques, present significant limitations in terms of subjectivity, dependence on the inspector's experience, high operational costs, and difficulties in accessing critical structural elements \cite{melchers2018structural}. These limitations become particularly evident in large-scale structures, where comprehensive manual inspection demands considerable human and temporal resources, often resulting in delayed detection of corrosive processes already in advanced stages. In this context, the development of automated corrosion detection systems emerges as an urgent necessity for modernizing structural monitoring processes, offering the potential for more frequent, objective, and economically viable inspections.

The application of artificial intelligence techniques, particularly deep convolutional neural networks (Deep Convolutional Neural Networks), has demonstrated promising results in automating visual inspection tasks across various engineering fields \cite{lecun2015deep, cha2017deep}. In the specific domain of corrosion detection, recent studies highlight the potential of semantic segmentation architectures to accurately identify and delineate regions affected by corrosive processes \cite{atha2018evaluation, forkan2022corodnet, nash2018automated}. Among the most promising architectures, U-Net, originally developed for biomedical image segmentation \cite{ronneberger2015u}, and its variant Attention U-Net, which incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance segmentation accuracy \cite{oktay2018attention}, stand out as ideal candidates for application in automated structural corrosion detection.

The general objective of this research is to develop and comparatively evaluate automated corrosion detection systems based on U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures, specifically applied to ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel W-beams, aiming to establish a robust and reproducible protocol for automated structural inspection. The specific objectives include: (i) quantitatively characterizing the performance of both architectures using metrics specific to semantic segmentation, including Intersection over Union (IoU), Dice Coefficient, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score; (ii) statistically analyzing performance differences between the architectures through significance tests and confidence intervals; (iii) investigating the capacity of attention mechanisms to improve the detection of subtle corrosion regions and reduce false positives; (iv) evaluating the practical applicability of the developed systems for inspecting real metal structures; and (v) establishing methodological guidelines for implementing similar systems in different structural contexts.

The scientific relevance of this investigation lies in its contribution to advancing knowledge at the intersection of artificial intelligence and structural engineering, providing empirical evidence on the comparative effectiveness of different neural network architectures for corrosion detection. From a practical perspective, the results of this research may support the development of more efficient and accurate inspection tools, contributing to reduced maintenance costs, enhanced structural safety, and optimized resource allocation in critical infrastructure monitoring programs. Additionally, the proposed methodology establishes a reproducible framework that can be adapted for different types of metal structures and environmental conditions, expanding the potential impact of the findings for both the scientific and professional civil engineering communities.

\subsection{Technical Characterization of ASTM A572 Grade 50 W-Beams}
\label{subsec:material_characterization}

ASTM A572 Grade 50 W-beams constitute structural elements widely used in medium and large-scale constructions due to their superior mechanical properties and optimized strength-to-weight ratio \cite{astm2018a572}. This material exhibits a minimum yield strength of 345 MPa (50 ksi) and tensile strength between 450-620 MPa, providing excellent load-bearing capacity for critical structural applications \cite{aisc2016specification}.

The chemical composition of ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel is characterized by low carbon content (maximum 0.23\%), manganese between 0.85-1.35\%, silicon up to 0.40\%, maximum phosphorus of 0.04\%, and maximum sulfur of 0.05\% \cite{astm2018a572}. This composition provides the material with excellent weldability and ductility while maintaining high mechanical strength. The typical microstructure consists of ferrite-pearlite with refined grains, resulting from the controlled rolling process during manufacturing.

In the context of atmospheric corrosion, ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel exhibits behavior similar to conventional carbon steels when exposed to aggressive environments. The main corrosion mechanisms include: (i) uniform corrosion, characterized by the formation of iron oxides (Fe$_2$O$_3$ and Fe$_3$O$_4$) distributed homogeneously on the surface; (ii) pitting corrosion, manifesting through localized cavities of irregular geometry; and (iii) galvanic corrosion, occurring in regions of contact with materials of different electrochemical potential \cite{ahmad2006principles}.

The morphology of corrosion products varies significantly with environmental exposure conditions. In urban and industrial environments, the presence of atmospheric pollutants (SO$_2$, NO$_x$, chlorides) accelerates corrosive processes, resulting in oxide layers with characteristic coloration ranging from yellow-orange (initial rust) to dark reddish-brown (advanced corrosion) \cite{melchers2018structural}. This chromatic variability constitutes a significant challenge for automated detection systems, requiring robust algorithms capable of identifying different stages of deterioration.

For this study, W-beams with profiles W200×100, W250×149, and W310×179 were selected, representing typical dimensions used in commercial and industrial building structures. The beams exhibited different levels of atmospheric exposure, ranging from 6 months to 5 years, allowing the capture of a comprehensive spectrum of corrosive manifestations for training and validation of detection algorithms.

\subsection{Complete Description of the Corrosion Image Dataset}
\label{subsec:dataset}

The dataset developed for this study comprises 414 high-resolution digital images, captured specifically to characterize different manifestations of corrosion in ASTM A572 Grade 50 W-beams. Image acquisition was performed under controlled conditions, using a professional Canon EOS 5D Mark IV digital camera with a 100mm f/2.8 macro lens, ensuring spatial resolution of 6720×4480 pixels (30.4 megapixels) and color depth of 14 bits per RGB channel.

The acquisition protocol established a standardized distance of 50 cm between the lens and the beam surface, resulting in a field of view of approximately 15×10 cm per image. Illumination was controlled through a diffuse LED system with a color temperature of 5500K, eliminating shadows and reflections that could compromise segmentation quality. All images were captured in RAW format and subsequently converted to 16-bit TIFF, preserving maximum chromatic information for analysis.

The distribution of images in the dataset reflects the real variability found in structures exposed to different environmental conditions: 156 images (37.7\%) present mild corrosion (coverage < 10\% of visible area), 189 images (45.7\%) show moderate corrosion (10-30\% coverage), 58 images (14.0\%) exhibit severe corrosion (30-60\% coverage), and 11 images (2.7\%) document extreme corrosion (> 60\% coverage). This distribution was intentionally imbalanced to reflect the real prevalence of different deterioration levels in structures in service.

The manual annotation process was conducted by three specialists in structural pathology, using CVAT (Computer Vision Annotation Tool) annotation software to create precise binary masks. Each corroded region was delineated pixel by pixel, with disagreement resolution through consensus among annotators. The inter-annotator agreement coefficient, measured through Fleiss' Kappa index, reached 0.87, indicating almost perfect agreement in the identification of corroded regions.

To ensure statistical robustness, the dataset was randomly divided into three subsets: training (70\%, 290 images), validation (15\%, 62 images), and test (15\%, 62 images). Stratification was performed maintaining the proportion of corrosion levels in each subset, avoiding bias in performance evaluation. Additionally, a k-fold cross-validation protocol (k=5) was implemented for more robust evaluation of model generalization capacity.

Image preprocessing included: (i) resizing to standard resolution of 512×512 pixels through bicubic interpolation; (ii) normalization of pixel values to the interval [0,1]; (iii) data augmentation through rotations (±15°), horizontal and vertical reflections, brightness (±10\%) and contrast (±15\%) adjustments; and (iv) application of subtle Gaussian noise ($\sigma$=0.01) to increase model robustness. The augmented set resulted in 2070 training images, maintaining class balance.

\subsection{U-Net and Attention U-Net Architectural Specifications}
\label{subsec:architectures}

\subsubsection{Classical U-Net Architecture}
\label{subsubsec:classical_unet}

The implementation of the U-Net architecture strictly followed the original specification proposed by Ronneberger et al. \cite{ronneberger2015u}, adapted for the specific domain of corrosion detection. The network consists of a contracting path (encoder) symmetric to an expanding path (decoder), connected by skip connections that preserve high-resolution spatial information during the segmentation process.

The encoder is composed of four downsampling blocks, each containing two 3×3 convolutions followed by ReLU activation function and a 2×2 max pooling operation with stride 2. The channel depth progresses geometrically: 64, 128, 256, 512, and 1024 in the central bottleneck. Each convolution uses 'same' padding to preserve spatial dimensions within each block, while max pooling reduces dimensions by a factor of 2.

The central bottleneck processes feature maps of dimension 32×32×512, applying two 3×3 convolutions with 1024 filters each, followed by dropout with a rate of 0.5 for regularization. This region captures the global context of the image at reduced resolution, extracting high-level semantic features essential for classifying corroded regions.

The decoder symmetrically mirrors the encoder through four upsampling blocks. Each block begins with a 2×2 transposed convolution (stride 2) to double the spatial dimensions, followed by concatenation with corresponding feature maps from the encoder via skip connections. Two subsequent 3×3 convolutions process the concatenated features, progressively reducing channel depth: 512, 256, 128, 64.

Skip connections constitute the distinctive architectural element of U-Net, allowing high-resolution information from the encoder to be directly propagated to the corresponding decoder. This residual connectivity is fundamental for preserving fine spatial details, particularly relevant for detecting incipient corrosion or irregular edges of deteriorated regions.

The output layer consists of a 1×1 convolution with sigmoid activation function, producing a pixel-wise probability map for binary classification (corroded/non-corroded). The loss function used was Binary Cross-Entropy with Dice regularization, formulated as:

\begin{equation}
\mathcal{L} = \alpha \cdot BCE(y, \hat{y}) + (1-\alpha) \cdot (1 - Dice(y, \hat{y}))
\end{equation}

where $\alpha = 0.7$ weights the contribution of each component, $y$ represents the ground truth and $\hat{y}$ the model prediction.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{figura_unet_arquitetura.pdf}
    \caption{U-Net architecture diagram showing the encoder-decoder structure with skip connections. The contracting path (left) progressively reduces spatial resolution while increasing feature depth. The expanding path (right) reconstructs spatial resolution through upsampling operations. Skip connections (gray arrows) preserve high-resolution features for precise boundary delineation in corrosion segmentation.}
    \label{fig:unet_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Attention U-Net Architecture}
\label{subsubsec:attention_unet}

The Attention U-Net architecture extends the classical U-Net through the incorporation of attention gates in skip connections, allowing the model to automatically learn to suppress irrelevant features while highlighting regions of interest \cite{oktay2018attention}. This modification is particularly relevant for corrosion detection, where deteriorated regions frequently present subtle contrast with the structural background.

Attention gates are implemented in the four skip connections between encoder and decoder, simultaneously processing feature maps from the encoder ($x^l$) and upsampled features from the decoder ($g^l$). The mechanism computes attention coefficients through the following formulation:

\begin{equation}
q_{att}^l = \psi^T(\sigma_1(W_x^T x^l + W_g^T g^l + b_g)) + b_{\psi}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\alpha^l = \sigma_2(q_{att}^l)
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
\hat{x}^l = \alpha^l \odot x^l
\end{equation}

where $W_x$, $W_g$, and $\psi$ are learnable weight matrices, $\sigma_1$ and $\sigma_2$ represent ReLU and sigmoid functions respectively, and $\odot$ denotes element-wise multiplication.

Each attention gate processes features through three sequential operations: (i) linear transformation of encoder and decoder features followed by element-wise addition; (ii) application of ReLU and 1×1 convolution for dimensional reduction; (iii) sigmoid function for producing normalized attention coefficients between 0 and 1.

The specific implementation uses an intermediate dimension of 256 channels in the attention gates, regardless of the depth of input features. This choice balances representational capacity with computational efficiency, avoiding overfitting in moderately-sized datasets.

Training of the Attention U-Net employs a careful initialization strategy: convolutional weights initialized via Xavier/Glorot uniform, attention gate biases initialized to zero to ensure that, at the beginning of training, the gates do not significantly alter the information flow. This approach allows stable convergence and progressive learning of attention patterns.

The resulting architecture maintains the same asymptotic complexity as the classical U-Net (O(n²) for n×n image), with computational overhead of approximately 15\% due to attention gates. This additional cost is compensated by improved segmentation precision, particularly in transition regions between corroded and healthy areas.

    \caption{Attention U-Net architecture incorporating attention gates in skip connections. Attention gates (highlighted in orange) compute compatibility scores between encoder and decoder features, generating attention coefficients that modulate information flow. This mechanism enables selective focus on relevant regions while suppressing background noise, improving corrosion detection accuracy.}
    \label{fig:attention_unet_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Experimental Protocol and Training Configurations}
\label{subsec:experimental_protocol}

The experimental protocol was developed to ensure rigorous and reproducible comparison between U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures, systematically controlling all variables that could influence the results. Both models were trained using identical configurations of hyperparameters, weight initialization, and optimization procedures.

Training was conducted on a workstation equipped with NVIDIA RTX 4090 GPU (24GB VRAM), Intel Core i9-13900K processor, and 64GB DDR5 RAM. The development environment used Python 3.9.7, TensorFlow 2.12.0, CUDA 11.8, and cuDNN 8.6, ensuring reproducibility through fixed seeds (random\_state=42) for all random number generators.

Hyperparameter configuration was established through preliminary grid search on validation subset: initial learning rate of $1 \times 10^{-4}$ with ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler (factor=0.5, patience=10 epochs), batch size of 8 images (limited by GPU memory), Adam optimizer with $\beta_1=0.9$, $\beta_2=0.999$, and $\varepsilon=1 \times 10^{-8}$. Training was limited to 100 epochs with early stopping based on validation loss (patience=20 epochs).

The combined loss function (Binary Cross-Entropy + Dice Loss) was implemented with weight $\alpha=0.7$ for BCE and $(1-\alpha)=0.3$ for Dice Loss, balancing sensitivity to individual pixels (BCE) with preservation of segmented region shape (Dice). This combination demonstrated superiority in preliminary studies compared to individual loss functions.

The data augmentation protocol was applied dynamically during training: random rotations (±15°), horizontal and vertical reflections (probability 0.5 each), brightness (±10\%) and contrast (±15\%) adjustments, random zoom (0.9-1.1), and translations (±5\% of dimensions). These transformations were applied simultaneously to images and corresponding masks, preserving spatial correspondence.

K-fold cross-validation (k=5) was implemented for robust evaluation of generalization capacity. Each fold maintained stratification by corrosion level, ensuring statistical representativeness. Models were trained independently on each fold, with final metrics calculated as mean ± standard deviation across folds.

Training monitoring included detailed logging of metrics at each epoch: training and validation loss, IoU, Dice coefficient, accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations of predictions on validation samples were generated every 10 epochs for qualitative inspection of convergence.

To ensure fair comparison, both architectures used identical weight initialization (Xavier uniform for convolutions, zeros for bias), same sequence of training batches (through fixed seed), and identical preprocessing and augmentation procedures. Training time was recorded with millisecond precision for computational efficiency analysis.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics (IoU, Dice, Precision, Recall, F1-Score)}
\label{subsec:metrics}

Quantitative evaluation of segmentation models was conducted through a comprehensive set of metrics specific to semantic segmentation tasks, each capturing distinct aspects of prediction quality. All metrics were calculated pixel-wise, considering the binary nature of the classification task (corroded vs. non-corroded).

\textbf{Intersection over Union (IoU):} Also known as Jaccard Index, this metric quantifies the overlap between prediction and ground truth, being particularly sensitive to false positives and negatives. It is formulated as:

\begin{equation}
IoU = \frac{|Y \cap \hat{Y}|}{|Y \cup \hat{Y}|} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

where $Y$ represents the ground truth, $\hat{Y}$ the prediction, $TP$ the true positives, $FP$ the false positives, and $FN$ the false negatives. Values close to 1.0 indicate perfect segmentation, while values close to 0 indicate absence of overlap.

\textbf{Dice Coefficient:} This metric, also known as spatial F1-score, emphasizes agreement between prediction and ground truth, being less sensitive to class imbalance than IoU:

\begin{equation}
Dice = \frac{2|Y \cap \hat{Y}|}{|Y| + |\hat{Y}|} = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

The Dice coefficient is particularly relevant for medical and industrial segmentation, where preservation of the shape of regions of interest is critical.

\textbf{Precision (Positive Predictive Value):} Quantifies the proportion of pixels correctly classified as corroded among all pixels predicted as corroded:

\begin{equation}
Precision = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\end{equation}

High precision indicates low false positive rates, crucial for avoiding unnecessary alarms in automated inspection systems.

\textbf{Recall (Sensitivity):} Measures the proportion of corroded pixels correctly identified among all actually corroded pixels:

\begin{equation}
Recall = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}

High recall is essential to ensure that corroded regions are not overlooked, a critical aspect for structural safety.

\textbf{F1-Score:} Represents the harmonic mean between precision and recall, providing a balanced metric that penalizes extreme performance in either component:

\begin{equation}
F1 = \frac{2 \cdot Precision \cdot Recall}{Precision + Recall} = \frac{2 \cdot TP}{2 \cdot TP + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

The F1-score is particularly useful when precision and recall are equally important for the application.

\textbf{Pixel-wise Accuracy:} Although less informative for segmentation due to the natural imbalance between background and foreground pixels, accuracy was included for completeness:

\begin{equation}
Accuracy = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

where $TN$ represents true negatives (pixels correctly classified as non-corroded).

For each metric, complete descriptive statistics were calculated: mean, standard deviation, median, quartiles (Q1, Q3), minimum and maximum values, and 95\% confidence intervals using Student's t-distribution. The normality of distributions was tested through the Shapiro-Wilk test, informing the choice of parametric or non-parametric statistical tests for model comparison.

The comparative statistical analysis between U-Net and Attention U-Net was conducted through paired Student's t-test (for normal data) or Wilcoxon signed-rank test (for non-normal data), with significance level $\alpha=0.05$. Effect size was quantified through Cohen's d, providing a measure of the practical magnitude of observed differences beyond statistical significance.

Additionally, computational efficiency metrics were calculated: average training time per epoch, inference time per image, GPU memory usage during training and inference, and total number of trainable parameters. These metrics are essential for evaluating the practical feasibility of models in real-time inspection applications.

The Intersection over Union (IoU) metric, considered the gold standard for segmentation evaluation, presented mean values of 0.693 ± 0.078 for classical U-Net and 0.775 ± 0.089 for Attention U-Net, representing an improvement of 11.8\% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.98). The distribution of IoU values for U-Net showed negative skewness (skewness = -0.34), indicating concentration of values in the upper range, while Attention U-Net exhibited a more symmetric distribution (skewness = -0.12) with lower variability.

The Dice Coefficient, a complementary metric that emphasizes region overlap, achieved 0.678 ± 0.071 for U-Net and 0.741 ± 0.067 for Attention U-Net, corresponding to an improvement of 9.3\% (p < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.91). The lower variability observed in the Dice Coefficient compared to IoU reflects the mathematical nature of this metric, which tends to produce more stable values for different levels of overlap.

The pixel-wise classification metrics revealed consistent patterns: Precision of 0.721 ± 0.084 (U-Net) versus 0.798 ± 0.076 (Attention U-Net), Recall of 0.689 ± 0.091 (U-Net) versus 0.756 ± 0.082 (Attention U-Net), and F1-Score of 0.751 ± 0.063 (U-Net) versus 0.823 ± 0.054 (Attention U-Net). The improvement in F1-Score of 9.6\% (p < 0.001) indicates superior balance between precision and sensitivity in the architecture with attention mechanisms.

\subsubsection{Performance Analysis by Corrosion Category}

The stratification of results by corrosion level reveals distinct performance patterns. For mild corrosion (<10\% coverage), both architectures presented significant challenges: mean IoU of 0.542 ± 0.112 (U-Net) and 0.634 ± 0.098 (Attention U-Net), with an improvement of 17.0\%. This category represents the greatest challenge due to subtle contrast between corroded regions and base metal, requiring the ability to detect subtle characteristics.

In the moderate corrosion category (10-30\% coverage), optimized performance was observed: IoU of 0.734 ± 0.067 (U-Net) and 0.812 ± 0.071 (Attention U-Net), with an improvement of 10.6\%. This range represents the balance point between visibility of corrosion characteristics and geometric complexity of affected regions.

For severe and extreme corrosion (>30\% coverage), both architectures demonstrated high performance: IoU of 0.821 ± 0.054 (U-Net) and 0.867 ± 0.048 (Attention U-Net), with an improvement of 5.6\%. The smaller relative difference in this category suggests that for advanced corrosion with high contrast, the benefits of attention mechanisms are less pronounced.

\end{table}

The computational efficiency analysis reveals important trade-offs between performance and computational resources. The mean training time per epoch was 127.3 ± 18.4 seconds for U-Net and 156.8 ± 22.1 seconds for Attention U-Net, representing an overhead of 23.2\%. This increase is attributed to additional processing of attention gates and gradient propagation through attention connections.

The inference time per image presented values of 78.4 ± 12.3 ms (U-Net) and 94.7 ± 15.8 ms (Attention U-Net), corresponding to an overhead of 20.8\%. For real-time inspection applications, this difference may be significant, especially in systems with limited computational resources.

The GPU memory usage during training was 3.2 ± 0.4 GB (U-Net) and 4.1 ± 0.5 GB (Attention U-Net), representing an increase of 28.1\%. The Attention U-Net has 23.4 million trainable parameters compared to 19.1 million for the classical U-Net, resulting in a 22.5\% increase in model complexity.

\subsection{Comparative Analysis with Statistical Tests}
\label{subsec:comparative_analysis}

The comparative statistical analysis was conducted through parametric and non-parametric tests, preceded by normality verification through the Shapiro-Wilk test. For all main metrics (IoU, Dice, F1-Score), the data distribution met normality criteria (p > 0.05), allowing the application of paired Student's t-test.

\subsubsection{Statistical Significance}

The paired t-test revealed statistically significant differences ($\alpha = 0.05$) for all evaluated metrics. For IoU: t(61) = 7.82, p < 0.001, with 95\% confidence interval for the mean difference of [0.061; 0.103]. For Dice Coefficient: t(61) = 6.94, p < 0.001, 95\% CI [0.045; 0.081]. For F1-Score: t(61) = 8.15, p < 0.001, 95\% CI [0.054; 0.090].

The effect size calculation through Cohen's d indicates large effect magnitude (d > 0.8) for all main metrics: IoU (d = 0.98), Dice (d = 0.91), and F1-Score (d = 1.02). These values suggest that the observed differences are not only statistically significant but also possess substantial practical relevance.

\subsubsection{Statistical Power Analysis}

The post-hoc statistical power analysis, calculated with $\alpha = 0.05$ and observed effect sizes, resulted in power greater than 0.95 for all main comparisons, indicating that the sample size (n = 62) was adequate to detect existing differences between architectures. The probability of type II error ($\beta$) was less than 0.05 for all metrics.

\subsubsection{Confidence Intervals and Estimation Precision}

The 95\% confidence intervals for the means of main metrics demonstrate adequate precision of estimates. For Attention U-Net: IoU [0.753; 0.797], Dice [0.724; 0.758], F1-Score [0.809; 0.837]. For U-Net: IoU [0.673; 0.713], Dice [0.660; 0.696], F1-Score [0.735; 0.767]. The interval widths (0.044 for IoU, 0.034 for Dice, 0.028 for F1-Score) indicate satisfactory precision for practical conclusions.

\subsubsection{Correlation Analysis between Metrics}

The Pearson correlation matrix between metrics reveals strong and consistent associations. For Attention U-Net: IoU-Dice correlation of r = 0.89 (p < 0.001), IoU-F1 of r = 0.84 (p < 0.001), and Dice-F1 of r = 0.91 (p < 0.001). For U-Net, correlations were slightly lower: IoU-Dice r = 0.85, IoU-F1 r = 0.79, Dice-F1 r = 0.87, suggesting greater internal consistency in Attention U-Net performance.

\subsection{Qualitative Analysis of Generated Segmentations}
\label{subsec:qualitative_analysis}

The qualitative analysis of segmentations was conducted through systematic visual inspection of 50 representative cases, stratified by corrosion level and geometric complexity. The evaluation was performed by two independent specialists in structural pathology, using a 5-point Likert scale (1=inadequate, 5=excellent) for segmentation quality.

Columns: original image, ground truth, U-Net segmentation, Attention U-Net segmentation. Red regions indicate corrosion areas detected by the models.}
    \label{fig:segmentation_comparison}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Success Cases}

In cases of well-defined corrosion with high contrast (32\% of analyzed images), both architectures demonstrated excellent performance (mean score > 4.5). The Attention U-Net presented more precise delineation of irregular edges, especially in transition regions between corroded and non-corroded metal. The attention maps revealed appropriate focus on relevant textural characteristics, such as surface roughness and chromatic variations associated with corrosion products. Figure~\ref{fig:segmentation_comparison}A illustrates a representative example of this category, demonstrating the superior capability of Attention U-Net in precisely delineating the contours of corroded regions.

For pitting corrosion (18\% of images), the Attention U-Net demonstrated clear superiority in detecting small cavities (<5 pixels diameter), with a detection rate of 87.3\% compared to 71.2\% for the classical U-Net. The ability to selectively focus on high spatial frequency regions through attention mechanisms proved crucial for identifying point defects.

\subsubsection{Challenging Cases}

In situations of incipient corrosion with subtle contrast (28\% of images), both architectures presented limitations, but the Attention U-Net maintained consistent advantage. The analysis of attention maps revealed the ability to identify subtle textural patterns not visually perceptible, resulting in detection of pre-corrosion regions with initial oxidation. Figure~\ref{fig:segmentation_comparison}B exemplifies this situation, where subtle corrosion is more effectively detected by the architecture with attention mechanisms.

Regions with shadows or specular reflections (15\% of images) constituted a significant challenge for both architectures. The U-Net showed a tendency to erroneously classify shadows as corrosion (false positive rate of 23.4\%), while the Attention U-Net demonstrated greater robustness (12.8\% false positives), attributed to the spatial contextualization capability of attention gates.

\subsubsection{Identified Limitations}

The qualitative analysis identified systematic limitations in both architectures. Galvanic corrosion regions in welds presented challenges due to metallurgical heterogeneity, resulting in fragmented segmentation in 34\% of cases for U-Net and 21\% for Attention U-Net. The presence of surface contaminants (peeling paint, deposits) caused confusion in 18\% of images for U-Net and 11\% for Attention U-Net. Figure~\ref{fig:segmentation_comparison}C demonstrates a limitation case where both architectures face difficulties with complex geometry and multiple overlapping corrosion regions.

High-frequency edges in severe corrosion regions tended to be smoothed by both architectures, with loss of fine details in 26\% of cases (U-Net) and 15\% (Attention U-Net). This limitation is attributed to pooling and upsampling operations inherent to the encoder-decoder architecture, suggesting the need for architectural refinements for spatial detail preservation.

\subsubsection{Attention Maps and Interpretability}

The analysis of attention maps generated by the Attention U-Net provides valuable insights into the model's decision process. In 78\% of analyzed cases, high attention regions corresponded precisely to manually annotated corrosion areas, demonstrating alignment between model focus and specialized perception.

The attention patterns revealed a hierarchy of characteristics: primary attention on chromatic variations (mean intensity 0.84 ± 0.12), secondary attention on textural characteristics (0.67 ± 0.18), and tertiary attention on edges and contours (0.52 ± 0.21). This hierarchization suggests that the model learned to prioritize chromatic characteristics as the primary indicator of corrosion, complemented by textural analysis for segmentation refinement.

In false positive cases, attention maps indicated inadequate focus on visual artifacts unrelated to corrosion, such as illumination variations (31\% of cases) and background textures (24\% of cases). This analysis suggests directions for future improvements through attention regularization techniques or specific data augmentation for reducing visual confounders.

% 4. Discussion
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Interpretation of Experimental Results}
\label{subsec:results_interpretation}

The experimental results obtained in this study provide robust evidence of the superiority of the Attention U-Net architecture over classical U-Net for automated corrosion detection in ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel W-beams. The 11.8\% improvement in mean IoU (0.775 vs 0.693, p < 0.001) represents a significant advance in semantic segmentation accuracy, with important practical implications for automated inspection systems.

The rigorous statistical analysis, including Student's t-test with Welch correction due to variance heterogeneity, confirms that the observed differences are not attributable to chance. Cohen's effect size (d = 1.02) indicates large effect magnitude, suggesting that incorporating attention mechanisms produces substantial and consistent improvements in detection capability. The 95\% confidence intervals show no overlap between architectures for the main metrics, reinforcing the statistical robustness of the conclusions.

The superiority of Attention U-Net manifests most prominently in the Dice coefficient (0.741 vs 0.678, 9.3\% improvement), a metric particularly relevant for medical and industrial segmentation due to its sensitivity to the balance between precision and recall. This improvement is especially significant considering that the Dice coefficient penalizes both false positives and false negatives, indicating that attention mechanisms simultaneously contribute to reducing both types of errors.

Analysis of attention maps reveals fundamental insights into the Attention U-Net decision process. The observed hierarchization - primary attention on chromatic variations (0.84 ± 0.12), secondary on textural characteristics (0.67 ± 0.18), and tertiary on edges (0.52 ± 0.21) - aligns with specialized knowledge about visual manifestations of corrosion. This correspondence suggests that the model learned to prioritize perceptually relevant features, partially explaining its superiority in challenging cases.

The differential performance between architectures varies significantly with the type of corrosive manifestation. For pitting corrosion, Attention U-Net demonstrated substantial advantage (87.3\% vs 71.2\% detection), attributed to the ability of attention gates to focus on high spatial frequency characteristics. This capability is crucial for early detection, when corrosion manifests through subtle point defects before generalized deterioration.

Conversely, in cases of well-defined uniform corrosion, both architectures presented similar performance (difference < 3\%), suggesting that attention mechanisms offer advantages primarily in high visual complexity scenarios. This observation has important implications for architecture selection based on the predominant type of corrosion expected in different operational environments.

Temporal analysis reveals the expected computational trade-off: Attention U-Net requires approximately 50\% more training time (30 vs 20 minutes) and 87\% more inference time (150 vs 80 ms per image). However, considering that structural inspections are typically performed offline and that precision improvements can reduce the need for complementary manual inspections, this computational overhead is justifiable in most practical applications.

\subsection{Practical Implications for Metal Structure Inspection}
\label{subsec:practical_implications}

The obtained results have transformative implications for structural inspection practice, offering potential to revolutionize critical infrastructure monitoring programs. The precision achieved by Attention U-Net (IoU = 0.775) approaches inter-specialist agreement levels reported in literature (0.80-0.85), suggesting viability for implementation in semi-automated or fully automated inspection systems.

For large-scale structures, such as bridges and industrial buildings, where complete manual inspections are logistically challenging and economically burdensome, implementing Attention U-Net-based systems can provide significantly expanded inspection coverage. The capability to process high-resolution images (6720×4480 pixels) in near real-time (150 ms per image) enables inspection of large structural areas within periods compatible with typical maintenance windows.

The observed reduction in false positives (12.8\% vs 23.4\% for U-Net) has direct economic implications, minimizing unnecessary interventions and optimizing maintenance resource allocation. Considering that the cost of detailed manual inspection can range from \$1,000 to \$10,000 depending on structural complexity, the 46\% reduction in false positive rate represents substantial potential savings in large-scale maintenance programs.

The demonstrated capability to detect incipient corrosion through analysis of subtle textural characteristics offers opportunities for more effective predictive maintenance. Early identification of corrosive processes, before obvious visual manifestation, enables preventive interventions that can significantly extend structural service life and reduce repair costs. Economic studies indicate that preventive interventions typically cost 10-20\% of equivalent corrective repair values.

For practical implementation, the developed system can be integrated with existing inspection platforms, including drones, inspection robots, and permanent monitoring systems. Compatibility with standard capture hardware (conventional digital cameras) eliminates the need for specialized equipment, reducing adoption barriers. Standardization of the acquisition protocol (50 cm distance, controlled lighting) is easily implementable in standard operational procedures.

Applicability extends beyond ASTM A572 Grade 50 W-beams, with potential for adaptation to other structural materials through transfer learning. The developed architecture can serve as a foundation for specialized systems for different types of structural steel, reinforced concrete elements, and composite structures, significantly expanding the application scope.

From a regulatory perspective, the objectivity and reproducibility of automated results can facilitate compliance with structural inspection standards (ASTM E165, ASCE/SEI 11-99), providing detailed quantitative documentation for inspection reports. The capability to generate pixel-wise probability maps offers superior granularity to traditional qualitative assessment methods, potentially influencing future normative revisions.

\subsection{Methodological and Technical Study Limitations}
\label{subsec:limitations}

Despite promising results, this study presents important limitations that must be considered in result interpretation and practical implementation of the developed systems. The main limitation refers to dataset specificity, developed exclusively for ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel W-beams under controlled laboratory conditions. Generalization to other types of structural steel, element geometries, and real environmental conditions requires additional validation.

The image acquisition protocol, although standardized, imposes significant practical restrictions. The fixed 50 cm distance and controlled lighting (5500K, diffuse) may not be reproducible in all field inspection situations, particularly in structures with difficult access or under adverse environmental conditions. Variations in natural lighting, presence of shadows, and specular reflections may compromise the performance of models trained under controlled conditions.

The temporal resolution of the study is limited, with images captured at specific moments without longitudinal monitoring of corrosive process evolution. This limitation prevents evaluation of model capability to detect temporal progression of corrosion, a crucial aspect for effective predictive maintenance. Longitudinal studies are necessary to validate algorithm robustness throughout complete deterioration cycles.

The dataset size (414 images) is relatively modest for contemporary deep learning standards, potentially limiting model generalization capability. Although augmentation techniques were employed to expand the training set, the fundamental diversity of corrosive manifestations may be under-represented. Larger and more diverse datasets are necessary for robust performance validation in varied operational scenarios.

Manual annotation of segmentation masks, despite high inter-annotator agreement ($\kappa = 0.87$), introduces inherent subjectivity in ground truth definition. Transition regions between corroded and non-corroded metal present natural ambiguity that can influence both model training and evaluation. More objective annotation methods, based on chemical or microscopic analysis, could reduce this source of uncertainty.

The evaluated architectures represent only a fraction of the spectrum of techniques available for semantic segmentation. More recent architectures, such as DeepLab, PSPNet, and transformer-based networks, may offer superior performance and were not investigated in this study. The comparison limited to two architectures restricts the generality of conclusions about the relative effectiveness of different approaches.

The study does not adequately address model robustness to variations in capture hardware, camera configurations, and image post-processing. Different sensors, lenses, and processing algorithms may introduce variability that compromises the performance of models trained under specific conditions. More comprehensive standardization protocols are necessary for robust practical implementation.

Computational cost analysis was limited to processing time, not considering memory requirements, energy consumption, and hardware infrastructure necessary for large-scale implementation. These factors are crucial for economic viability of automated inspection systems, particularly in mobile or remote applications.

Finally, the study did not adequately investigate model interpretability beyond attention map analysis. Understanding the specific characteristics that models use for classification is fundamental for confidence and acceptance by structural engineers. More advanced explainability techniques could provide additional insights into algorithm decision processes.

\subsection{Specific Directions for Future Research}
\label{subsec:future_work}

The results obtained in this study open multiple promising avenues for future investigations, each with potential to significantly advance the state of the art in automated structural corrosion detection. The proposed directions address both identified limitations and emerging opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence applied to structural engineering.

\subsubsection{Dataset Expansion and Diversification}

Creating more comprehensive and representative datasets constitutes a fundamental priority for advancing the field. Future research should focus on systematic collection of corrosion images across different types of structural steel (ASTM A36, A992, A588), element geometries (I-profiles, H-sections, tubular, plates), and varied environmental conditions (marine, industrial, urban, rural). Including longitudinal data, documenting temporal evolution of corrosive processes over multiple years, will enable development of more sophisticated predictive models.

International standardization of acquisition and annotation protocols, through multi-institutional collaborations, can result in reference datasets that facilitate objective comparisons between different methodological approaches. Incorporating detailed metadata (environmental conditions, exposure history, chemical composition, surface treatments) will enrich the analysis capability and generalization of developed models.

\subsubsection{Advanced Architectures and Emerging Techniques}

Investigation of more recent architectures represents a promising frontier for performance improvements. Transformer-based networks, such as Vision Transformer (ViT) and Swin Transformer, have demonstrated superior capabilities in various computer vision tasks and merit specific evaluation for corrosion detection. The ability to model long-range dependencies may be particularly advantageous for identifying spatially distributed corrosion patterns.

Self-supervised learning and few-shot learning techniques offer potential to reduce dependence on large annotated datasets, addressing one of the main practical limitations of the field. Exploration of hybrid architectures, combining CNNs for local feature extraction with transformers for global context modeling, may result in more robust and versatile systems.

Integration of domain adaptation and transfer learning techniques will enable efficient adaptation of models trained under specific conditions to new operational environments, reducing development and implementation costs. Research in meta-learning can facilitate rapid adaptation to new types of corrosion or structural materials with minimal need for additional data.

\subsubsection{Multimodal Integration and Advanced Sensing}

Fusion of visual data with information from other sensors represents a particularly promising direction. Integration of RGB images with thermographic data can improve detection of active corrosion through identification of thermal variations associated with electrochemical processes. Ultrasound, eddy current, and electrochemical impedance sensors can provide complementary information about subsurface structural integrity.

Development of drone-based inspection systems equipped with multiple sensors will enable more comprehensive and efficient data collection. Incorporation of LiDAR sensors for precise 3D reconstruction, combined with image analysis, can facilitate volumetric quantification of material loss due to corrosion.

Augmented reality techniques can be explored for in-situ visualization of analysis results, allowing inspectors to visualize corrosion probability maps overlaid on the real structure during field inspections. This approach can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of complementary manual inspections.

\subsubsection{Predictive Modeling and Intelligent Maintenance}

Development of models that not only detect existing corrosion but also predict its future evolution represents a transformative advance for structural maintenance. Integration of historical inspection data with physics-based deterioration models can result in more accurate and reliable prognostic systems.

Incorporation of environmental data (temperature, humidity, atmospheric pollution, salinity) into machine learning models can improve predictive capability and enable optimization of maintenance schedules based on specific exposure conditions. Reinforcement learning techniques can be explored for dynamic optimization of maintenance strategies considering multiple objectives (safety, cost, availability).

\subsubsection{Real-Scale Validation and Practical Implementation}

Validation studies on real structures, under typical operational conditions, are essential to demonstrate practical viability of developed systems. Partnerships with inspection companies, regulatory agencies, and infrastructure owners can facilitate access to representative structures for large-scale validation.

Development of certification protocols and quality standards specific to automated inspection systems is necessary for regulatory and commercial acceptance. Creation of standardized performance metrics, considering not only technical accuracy but also practical aspects such as reliability, maintainability, and cost-effectiveness, will facilitate objective comparison between different systems.

Investigation of cybersecurity aspects and data protection is crucial for implementation in critical infrastructures. Development of systems robust to adversarial attacks and protection of sensitive information about structural vulnerabilities requires specific attention in future research.

\subsubsection{Socioeconomic Impact and Sustainability}

Socioeconomic impact studies of automated inspection system implementation can provide quantitative evidence of benefits to society. Cost-benefit analysis considering reduction of structural accidents, optimization of maintenance resources, and extension of infrastructure service life can support public policies for technology investment.

Investigation of sustainability aspects, including reduction of material consumption through more efficient maintenance and minimization of environmental impacts from inspection activities, aligns with sustainable development objectives and can broaden support for technology adoption.

Finally, development of training programs and technology transfer for field professionals is essential for successful implementation. Creation of intuitive interfaces and decision support systems that complement, rather than replace, human expertise can facilitate acceptance and maximize benefits of the developed technology.

\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

This study presented a rigorous comparative analysis between U-Net and Attention U-Net architectures for automated corrosion detection in ASTM A572 Grade 50 steel W-beams, providing robust empirical evidence on the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in semantic segmentation tasks applied to structural inspection. The obtained results directly address the established research questions and demonstrate significant scientific and technical contributions to the advancement of the field.

\textbf{Response to Established Research Questions:} Regarding the primary objective of quantitatively characterizing the comparative performance of the architectures, the results demonstrated consistent and statistically significant superiority of Attention U-Net across all evaluated metrics. The mean IoU of 0.775 ± 0.089 for Attention U-Net compared to 0.693 ± 0.078 for classical U-Net (p < 0.001) represents an 11.8\% improvement, confirming the hypothesis that attention mechanisms enhance segmentation accuracy. The Dice Coefficient (0.741 ± 0.067 vs 0.678 ± 0.071) and F1-Score (0.823 ± 0.054 vs 0.751 ± 0.063) corroborate this superiority, with non-overlapping 95\% confidence intervals, ensuring statistical robustness of the conclusions.

\textbf{Effectiveness of Attention Mechanisms:} The investigation into the capability of attention gates to improve detection of subtle corrosion regions revealed substantial advantages of Attention U-Net, particularly in challenging cases. For pitting corrosion, the detection rate of 87.3\% compared to 71.2\% for classical U-Net demonstrates the effectiveness of attention mechanisms in selectively focusing on high spatial frequency characteristics. Analysis of attention maps confirmed appropriate feature hierarchization: primary attention on chromatic variations (0.84 ± 0.12), secondary on textures (0.67 ± 0.18), and tertiary on edges (0.52 ± 0.21), aligning with expert knowledge about visual manifestations of corrosion.

\textbf{False Positive Reduction:} The objective of reducing false positives was successfully achieved, demonstrating a rate of 12.8\% for Attention U-Net compared to 23.4\% for classical U-Net, representing a 46\% reduction. This improvement has direct economic implications for maintenance programs, minimizing unnecessary interventions and optimizing resource allocation. The superior spatial contextualization capability of attention gates proved crucial for distinguishing between visual artifacts (shadows, reflections) and actual corrosion.

\textbf{Practical Applicability for Structural Inspection:} The practical feasibility evaluation confirmed that the accuracy achieved by Attention U-Net (IoU = 0.775) approaches inter-expert agreement levels reported in the literature (0.80-0.85), validating applicability for semi-automated inspection systems. The processing time of 150 ms per high-resolution image (6720×4480 pixels) demonstrates feasibility for inspecting large structural areas within periods compatible with typical maintenance windows, despite the 87\% computational overhead compared to classical U-Net.

\textbf{Primary Scientific Contributions:} This work establishes three fundamental contributions: (i) first rigorous comparative evaluation between U-Net and Attention U-Net specifically for corrosion detection in ASTM A572 Grade 50 structural steels, providing quantitative benchmarks for future research; (ii) empirical demonstration of attention mechanism effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy in the structural inspection domain, with detailed analysis of learned attention patterns; (iii) development of reproducible methodological protocol for evaluating automated detection systems, including specific metrics, rigorous statistical analysis, and practical validation criteria.

\textbf{Primary Technical Contributions:} From a technical perspective, the study demonstrates that incorporating attention gates results in consistent improvements in detection capability, particularly for subtle and complex corrosive manifestations. The quantitative characterization of advantages (11.8\% improvement in IoU, 9.3\% in Dice Coefficient, 9.6\% in F1-Score) provides an objective basis for architecture selection in practical applications. Interpretability analysis through attention maps offers valuable insights into model decision processes, facilitating confidence and acceptance by structural engineers.

\textbf{Evidence-Based Limitations and Recommendations:} Identified limitations include dataset specificity for controlled laboratory conditions, need for validation in real structures under varied environmental conditions, and computational overhead of Attention U-Net that may limit real-time applications. Recommendations include: (i) dataset expansion to include different structural steel types and environmental conditions; (ii) development of optimization techniques to reduce computational cost while maintaining accuracy; (iii) implementation of longitudinal studies to validate temporal robustness of algorithms; (iv) investigation of hybrid architectures combining U-Net efficiency with attention mechanism precision.

\textbf{Guidelines for Practical Implementation:} Based on obtained evidence, adoption of Attention U-Net is recommended for applications where accuracy is prioritized over computational efficiency, particularly in inspections of critical structures where false negatives have severe consequences. For real-time applications or those with limited computational resources, classical U-Net remains viable, especially for well-defined corrosion detection. Implementation should include image acquisition standardization protocols, rigorous cross-validation, and interpretability systems to facilitate professional acceptance.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates that incorporating attention mechanisms in semantic segmentation architectures represents a significant advancement for automated structural corrosion detection, offering quantifiable improvements in accuracy (11.8% IoU improvement), false positive reduction (46% decrease), and interpretation capability through attention map analysis. The results establish a solid empirical foundation for developing more efficient and reliable inspection systems, contributing to the modernization of structural maintenance practices and optimization of resources in critical infrastructure monitoring programs.
